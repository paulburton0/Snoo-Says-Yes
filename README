    Better-Reddit-check

 Better-Reddit-check is a Google Chrome / Chromium extension based on 
 the Reddit-Check extension created by Hrishikesh Bakshi.

 submitted to reddit. You can jump right into the discussion if the link 
 has already been submitted. Otherwise a 'Submit this link' option 
 is provided to go to reddit link submission page.
